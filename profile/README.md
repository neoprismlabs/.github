# NeoPrism Labs

## Overview

NeoPrism Labs develops open-source UI technologies focusing on distinctive visual design systems and developer experience. Our flagship project is a neobrutalism-inspired UI toolkit for Flutter, providing developers with a comprehensive component library featuring bold borders, vibrant colors, and interactive shadow effects.

## Architecture

### Plugin Architecture

NeoPrism components are built on a flexible plugin architecture that enables:

- **Analytics Integration**: Components report user interactions that can be captured by analytics providers
- **Extensible Component System**: Core components can be extended with custom behaviors
- **Localization Support**: Text elements support internationalization through pluggable translation providers
- **Theme Inheritance**: Components inherit from a centralized theme while supporting local customization

Our architecture follows composition over inheritance principles, making components both flexible and maintainable. Each component is built using a consistent state management pattern that enables tracking capabilities while maintaining Flutter's performance characteristics.

## Developer Environment

### Component Development

Components follow a standardized development framework:

1. Abstract base classes define component contracts
2. State management follows Flutter best practices
3. Theming integrates with the global system
4. All components include comprehensive test coverage

### Contributing

We welcome contributions following our development guidelines:

- Components must implement the `NeoPrismComponent` interface
- All user interactions should support tracking
- Components should be fully accessible
- Documentation must include examples and property descriptions
