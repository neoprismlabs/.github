# NeoPrism Labs

## Overview

NeoPrism Labs develops a comprehensive Flutter UI toolkit implementing neobrutalism design principles. Our component libraries feature bold borders, vibrant colors, and interactive shadow effects that create a distinctive visual identity while maintaining production-ready quality standards.

## Architecture Vision

### Component Design Philosophy

Our components follow a structured hierarchy designed for consistency and extensibility:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[NeoPrismComponent] --> B[Interactive Components]
    A --> C[Display Components]
    A --> D[Layout Components]
    
    B --> BA[NeoButton]
    B --> BB[NeoInput]
    B --> BC[NeoCheckbox]
    B --> BD[NeoToggle]
    B --> BE[NeoDropdown]
    B --> BF[NeoSlider]
    
    C --> CA[NeoBadge]
    C --> CB[NeoCard]
    C --> CC[NeoProgressBar]
    
    D --> DA[NeoContainer]
    D --> DB[NeoGrid]
    
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Planned Plugin Architecture

Our roadmap includes a pluggable architecture that will enable:

```mermaid

    A[NeoPrism Core] --> B[Analytics Plugin]
    A --> C[Localization Plugin]
    A --> D[Theme Extension Plugin]
    A --> E[Custom Plugin]
    
    B --> BA[Google Analytics]
    B --> BB[Firebase Analytics]
    B --> BC[Custom Analytics]
    
    C --> CA[Flutter Intl]
    C --> CB[Easy Localization]
    
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#336,stroke-width:4px
```

All components emit standardized interaction events that can be captured and processed by analytics plugins, enabling comprehensive user behavior tracking while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Component Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Hovered: Mouse Enter
    Hovered --> Pressed: Mouse Down
    Pressed --> Released: Mouse Up
    Released --> Hovered: Stay Hovered
    Released --> Triggered: Action Executed
    Hovered --> Idle: Mouse Exit
    Triggered --> Idle
    
    note right of Triggered
        Analytics event emitted
        with component metadata
    end note
```

Each component implements this interaction lifecycle, providing consistent behavior and predictable analytics events.

## Development Standards

Our components adhere to strict development standards:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component Development] --> B[1. Interface Definition]
    B --> C[2. State Management]
    C --> D[3. Theme Integration]
    D --> E[4. Interaction Tracking]
    E --> F[5. Accessibility]
    F --> G[6. Documentation]
    G --> H[7. Testing]
```

### Code Organization

```mermaid

    A[lib/] --> B[src/]
    B --> C[components/]
    B --> D[theme/]
    B --> E[analytics/]
    
    C --> C1[abstract/]
    C --> C2[buttons/]
    C --> C3[input/]
    C --> C4[display/]
    C --> C5[layout/]
```
